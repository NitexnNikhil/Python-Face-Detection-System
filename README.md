# Python-Face-Detection-System


Motion Detection System using Python and OpenCV  Overview: This motion detection system utilizes computer vision techniques to detect motion in a video stream or webcam feed. It captures consecutive frames, calculates the difference between them, and identifies regions with significant changes as potential motion.

->Python: The programming language used for implementing the motion detection system.
->OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library): A popular open-source computer vision and machine learning software library, primarily aimed at real-time computer vision.
->Frame Capture: The process of capturing frames from a video stream or webcam feed.
->Frame Difference: Calculating the absolute difference between consecutive frames to detect changes.
->Thresholding: Applying a threshold to the frame difference to segment areas of significant change.
->Contour Detection: Identifying contours in the thresholded image to outline regions of motion.
->Bounding Box: Drawing rectangles around detected motion regions to highlight them.
->Motion Tracking: Optionally, tracking the movement of detected objects across frames.
->Event Triggering: Triggering actions or alerts when motion is detected, such as sending notifications or saving video clips.
